# A quick overview 

This project is my internship work in [JdeRobot open source organization](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/) which develops a collection of exercises and challenges to learn robotics in a practical way. It includes exercises about drone programming, computer vision, mobile robots, autonomous cars, etc and all mainly based on Gazebo simulator and ROS. 

By the time I joined the organization, they were primarily working on new release 2.3 which is migrating all the available exercises to new web-templates paradigm. I decided to take on one of those exercises which is **Global Navigation** and it was quiet challenging for the migration.
